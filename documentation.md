# Explore mtcars dataset


This Shiny application helps you explore the built-in mtcars dataset. To begin select the "Data" tab and choose the feature you would like to analyze. Histogram of this feature will be built. You can then select sample quantile to be estimated (e.g. 0.5 for median or 1.0 for maximum value) and the result will be calculated immediately.
